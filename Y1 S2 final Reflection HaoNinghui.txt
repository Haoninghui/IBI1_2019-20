During this course, I can do some simple statistic analysis using Python (plot, read, numpy, string, many loops like for if while)
Some common file form like fasta, xml, txt, png can be read, wrote, saved under my code command. Also, L12 consolidated the probobility that learnt in Semester 1.
I have know the development that how scientists studied on DNA sequence and applied the silico methods to analyze (L10)
The related evaluation of code were also clear.

(Reflection on doing the practical 
(at first I misunderstood the instruction and thought to write reflections on practical)

I hope that we could have some small practice to consolid the use of newly learned before we do the practical. And when I do the practical,
the major difficulty I came across was that I could not apply what I learnt to use and did not know how to write the code to perfom my process.
So it took a large amount of time to de the parcticals and I must refer to the lecture, ask others and see what was on the discussion board, search
the solution on the Internet (but always cannot find) and do these four over and over again. So I wish there will be some some exercises to get us 
fimilar with Python (others in the future) and then do the practicals.

When I found somewhere that could further develop or errors, most time I could not fix them myself. So I just write the problems at the end of my code and 
sometimes turn to someone else. Things may better after we have some knowledge about normal error types and how to fix them.

Anyway, after practicals, I do learn Python better.)
